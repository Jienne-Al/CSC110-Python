'''3 criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
The year is evenly divisible by 4;
If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
Write a function that takes a year as a parameter and returns True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.'''
